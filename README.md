## Software Engineer | MBA | Technology | Business

Hi, I'm Aaron! My professional career extends 6+ years and for the last year of it, I've been studying software development full time. It's an exciting time for me, and I've enjoyed the process of coming from learning the fundamentals of HTML to now being able to build out full-stack applications in multiple languages. I've listed a few projects below and as I continue my personal development, more will be added. Enjoy!
