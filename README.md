## Software Engineer | MBA | Technology | Business

Hi, I'm Aaron! My professional career extends 6+ years in Logistics & Supply Chain Management and for the last year, I've been studying software development full time. It's an exciting time for me, and I've enjoyed the process of learning the fundamentals of JavaScript to now being able to build out full-stack applications in multiple languages. I've listed a few projects below and as I continue my personal development, more will be added. Enjoy!
